            As a hands-on IT architect, I specialize in crafting solutions
            tailored to your unique challenges. Whether you're seeking scalable
            systems or swift market-fit solutions, I prioritize simplicity,
            elegance, pragmatism, and quality to ensure your needs are met. Some
            key areas I could assist with:

              strong background in (Customer) Identity & Access Management, I
              can assist with designing / building your customer or employee IAM
              solution.

            <li key="2">
              <strong>Event driven architectures:</strong> Any distributed
              system can heavily benefit from a well designed event-driven
              (async) messaging solution. In the past I have built a fully
              serverless event-driven architecture solution that served many
              services and processed billions of events.
            </li>
            <li key="3">
              <strong>Multi-tenant system design:</strong> The efficiency that
              multitenancy can bring you is very high. However, there are many
              challenges that you need to overcome when designing a multi-tenant
              system. Especially, when this system is a distributed system that
              consists of multiple (micro)services.
            </li>
            <li key="4">
              <strong>(Micro)Services architecture design:</strong> Setting the
              right boundaries for your (micro)services is one of the most
              challenging things to do right. With the experience that I bring,
              I can assist in making the right choices from the start and
              prevent a lot of problems further down the line.

              Going generic too early can come with a very high price, on the
              other hand doing it too late i also expensive. As I have seen an
              organization from start-up to scale-up, I know the different
              phases of a company and know when to go generic and when a
              specific solution is the better choice.
